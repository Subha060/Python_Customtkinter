# CustomTKinter Projects
<br>
<br>
This repository contains my initial Python programs that use the customtkinter module, a wrapper for the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The programs demonstrate how to create various widgets, layouts, and dialogs using customtkinter. To run the programs, you need to have Python 3 and customtkinter installed on your system.
