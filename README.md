# CustomTKinter Projects
<br>
<br>
This repository contains my initial Python programs that use the customtkinter module, a wrapper for the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The programs demonstrate how to create various widgets, layouts, and dialogs using customtkinter. To run the programs, you need to have Python 3 and customtkinter installed on your system.

The Python code uses customtkinter and tkinter libraries to create a GUI with a checkbox. tkinter is a standard Python library for GUIs, and customtkinter provides a modern look. A Tk instance, root, represents the main window. A CTkCheckbutton is created with root as the parent widget, and options for text and font. The text sets the checkbox label to "Check me", and font sets the label font to Arial size 20. The pack method positions the widget within its parent. The mainloop method starts the GUI event loop, which waits for user interaction and responds to events.
